\section{Introduction}
Will be studying IBE. A type of Asymmetric paired keys 
encryption system. Charcterised with the fact that one of its
keys identifies the recipient (email...phone no).

Makes a lot of sense to compare with classical 
systems currently in use such as RSA.

So let's compare both systems and try to explain why IBE is not as popular

\subsection{Introduction to Public Key Cryptography}
Public Key Cryptography, also called Asymmetric Cryptography is an 
encryption scheme. In other words, it is a method for encrypting messages.
Unlike symmetric cryptography which uses the same key for both encrypting and decrypting
messages, asymmetric cryptography uses two different keys such that one 
is used for encrypting and the other for decrypting information.
In this context, a key is a string of characters that is used in some mathematical
formula to turn a information (a message for example) such that it is impossible to understand in its encrypted form. 
Similarly, we would then also use a key to map the encrypted information back to its original, usable form.
In asymmetric encryption, we typically call the encryption key
the Public Key, and the decryption key the Private Key.
The first asymmetric key cryptosystem was published in 1976 by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, previously,
all useful modern encryption system used symmetric key encryption systems. 
While both systems still have their usages in todays world,
asymmetric key encryption systems are now used on a daily basis throughout the world. With 
systems such as both HTTP over TLS and HTTP over SSL protocols, digitally signed files, bitcoin,
encrypted messaging services and many other all using some for of asymmetric encryption. 

\subsubsection{How it works}
Put simply, let's say we had a public key $K_{public}$ and $K_{private}$.
We would then obtain a ciphertext $cipher$ with the following formula: 
\begin{equation*}
    cipher = K_{public}(message)
\end{equation*}
Similarly, we obtain the original message from the ciphertext with the following formula:
\begin{equation*}
    message = K_{private}(cipher)
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Different implementations}
There are many different implementations of asymmetric 

\subsubsection{Requirements for public key algorithms (key gen, encrypt and decrypt)}
explain Requirements here

\subsubsection{How RSA is Implemented}
Perhaps on of the most famous system based on public key cryptography is RSA.
An RSA encryption scheme uses 3 different algorithms, Setup, Encryption and Decryption. \\
Setup in this case is the process of generating both Public and Private keys.
The algorithm used for this is the following:

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
