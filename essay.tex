\section{Introduction}
Will be studying IBE. A type of Asymmetric paired keys 
encryption system. Charcterised with the fact that one of its
keys identifies the recipient (email...phone no).

Makes a lot of sense to compare with classical 
systems currently in use such as RSA.

So let's compare both systems and try to explain why IBE is not as popular



\subsection{What is public key encryption ?}
Explain public / asymmetric key paired encryption

\subsubsection{How it works}
explain concepts of public key encryption

\subsection{Different ways it is implemented}
explain different implementations

\subsubsection{Requirements for public key algorithms (key gen, encrypt and decrypt)}
explain Requirements here

\subsubsection{Explain how RSA works}
explain RSA systems - a typical implementation

\subsubsection{Explain how IBE works}
explain IBE systems

\subsection{Math Systems at the core of Public Key Encryption}
Explain that at the core of public key encryption, underlies
many important mathematical concepts.

\subsubsection{Extended euclidean algo to find gcd, coefficients}
euclidean algo

\subsubsection{Fermat's little theorem}
fermats little thm, its place in public crypto

\subsubsection{Prime numbers}
prime numbers at the core of crypto

\subsubsection{Discrete logarithms}
discrete log problem

\subsubsection{Chinese remainder theorem}
chinese remainded thm at the core of decryption (or encryption)

\subsubsection{Square and multiply}
square and multiply to compute large exponents

\subsection{What is identity based encryption ?}
Explain what is exactly IBE now that we know more about public key encryption

\subsubsection{IBE typical implementation}
how is an IBE system implemented

\subsubsection{What are its advantages and flaw?}
pros and cons of IBE

\subsection{IBE vs RSA}
Compare the two

\subsubsection{Attacks on IBE Public key systems}
Go through possible attacks on Public key systems

\subsubsection{Are these attacks all possible on IBE? is it better or worse with IBE?}
go through how IBE protects from attacks differently than rsa systems

\subsubsection{which is most safe?}
expalin which system is safest


% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centering
%\subfloat[Case I]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
